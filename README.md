This project is an extension of the lvl 2 haunted house project that counts under
Java script level 7. When level 7 project was announced as a creative project, I had an idea to use that time to go overboard on the level 2 project instead of creating another project. Hopefully this is ok.

Level 2 Project goes up to Version 1.0.0 while Level 7 is all changes done after that.

Note: I may have committed some of these changes to the level 2 repo so the differences may not be apparent at first.

Some of these extension changes include: 
-Adding Mobile Responsivness across the whole website
-Increasing accessibility across the whole website
-Adding an advanced main menu using customized toggleable divs controlled via javascript.
-Updating the web server to be HTTPS on my personal web server urbanprofessional.de
-Updating images and general refining of the gameplay
-Updating Audio (Copyright Free)
-Adding a bonus.html page for finding all game secrets (Hidden Buttons that all need to be found to access it when the game is won)
-Adding entirely new sequence as the backstage, this was definitely the biggest part of the extension. Played with opacity and other unique css properties to achieve this.
